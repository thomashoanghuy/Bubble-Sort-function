 #inner loop will compare between 2 values next to each other and switch the larger number to second place. End of loop, will result in largest number of the array - 
 #- pushed to the last index. Outer loop is to cut off the last index (since it's already sorted to be the largest value) and prepare the shorter length of array-
 # for the inner loop to run again. Each time the inner loop runs, will push the largest value of that array to last index and len(arr) reduced to 1
